# Project Summary:

Implemented a machine learning pipeline for wheat kernel classification and clustering analysis using a dataset of geometric measurements from three wheat varieties (Kama, Rosa, and Canadian). Key accomplishments:


- Performed dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to transform 7-dimensional wheat kernel data into 2D representation
- Built and optimized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using GridSearchCV
- Implemented K-means clustering with optimal cluster selection using KElbowVisualizer
- Created data visualization pipelines using matplotlib to represent clustering results and PCA transformations
- Utilized scikit-learn for preprocessing (StandardScaler), model building, and evaluation

# Technical Skills Demonstrated:

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (SVM, K-means clustering, PCA)
    - Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
    - Model Optimization (GridSearchCV)
- Data Visualization (matplotlib)

### Note
This was my final project for my machine learning class.
